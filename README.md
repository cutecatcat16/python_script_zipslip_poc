Create a python3 script that does the following: 

1. Create a zip file base on the flag -n provided by the user. 
2. Take a file path to a file to include in the zip file (-p) 
3. Take also a -z argument to include in the filename to include the number of ../

The usage should be like this: 

python slip.py -n poc.zip -p ./file.jsp -z '../../../../../'
